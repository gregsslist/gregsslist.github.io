Phosea just landed. — Today at 14:21<br/>
[14:26]Úna: Hello Phosea. As the client for my project I would like to ask a series of seven questions pertaining to my product's design<br/>
[14:28]Phosea: yes ? <br/>
[14:29]Úna: The first question I would like to ask is are you from Estonia/interested in Estonia?<br/>
[14:30]Phosea: i'm not from estonia but i'm interested in it<br/>
[14:31]Úna: I see, yes.<br/>
[14:31]Úna: Second question - How would you feel about investing in / buying a souvenir product for the country of Estonia?<br/>
[14:32]Phosea: i'd be up for that<br/>
[14:32]Úna: That tracks<br/>
[14:32]Úna: My third question is<br/>
[14:32]Úna: Ideally, how big/small would you like a souvenir product to be?<br/>
[14:36]Phosea: not too small or large, roughly the size of an average decoration on a mantelpiece, windowsill or bookshelf while still being visible enough, so probably hand sized.<br/>
[14:37]Úna: I see<br/>
[14:37]Úna: I thought much the same<br/>
[14:38]Úna: Question four: As well as that previous question, what would be a maximum/minimum weight be for the souvenir?<br/>
[14:41]Phosea: maximum weight would probably be 1kg. the minimum weight is anything that prevents it from getting moved by wind and such, unless it was some kind of flying thing<br/>
[14:41]Phosea: in that case it'd probably be worth having a weight to keep it weighed down with when it wasn't in use<br/>
[14:41]Úna: Keep in mind this product would probably be taken over flights/car travel<br/>
[14:44]Phosea: oh then definitely nothing fragile. it'd ideally not be too expensive to ship through the mail<br/>
[14:45]Úna: Question five - What’s the maximum amount of money you would spend on a souvenir of that size?<br/>
[14:45]Úna: :bullofheaven:<br/>
[14:48]Phosea: it would depend on the quality, but i probably wouldn't go past £100 (maybe £10-20 extra) unless i was extremely interested in it, most likely due to a personal connection to something about it or finding it to be one-of-a-kind in a way that i was VERY interested in.<br/>
[14:50]Úna: That ties into question six<br/>
[14:50]Úna: Would the product need to be especially high quality?<br/>
[14:52]Phosea: that would be dependent on what purpose it served, or what i was looking for in it, e.g. if it was a decoration and had multiple textures, would these look good? plus any other aspects of it<br/>
[14:52]Úna: Yes<br/>
[14:54]Úna: Uh ok final question<br/>
[14:54]Úna: Question 7<br/>
[14:54]Úna: Does the product have to be made in a particularly sustainable way?<br/>
[14:57]Phosea: considering its a souvenir, i would prefer it ideally. i'd go for a sustainably made souvenir over one that wasn't, but if i really wanted one then i'd buy whatever was available (unless it was something absurdly pollutative and soaked in benzene and bromine and whatnot)<br/>
[14:59]Úna: That may be an issue. I already soaked the wood in Bromine.<br/>
[14:59]Úna: And so that concludes our interview, do you have any final questions of your own?<br/>
[15:02]Phosea: would it be possible to use radium paint to add glow in the dark features, and to add a sodium amalgam fountain as an additional paid upgrade?<br/>
[15:03]Úna: The investors in Guangdong Province may not like that <br/>
[15:03]Phosea: that's a shame. understandable nontheless<br/>
[15:04]Phosea: i have no more questions but i am certainly interested in purchasing this souvenir<br/>
